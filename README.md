This is a Zoom automation program. Ususally you will find these types of programs on YouTube ,
but my school doesn't have a time table and they give the timetable of next day , a day before...
So I have created a python program which can be edited to automatically attend classes based on the timetable given.
This data can be edited in data.py
Few points to note:
  Provide the Time in 24 hour format
  Change the zoom meeting link according to the subject
  Make sure that the subject name and match in data.py and main.py 
  Remap your End meeting shortcut in main.py and in zoom settings
  If there is anything to improve pls let me know
  Make Sure you enable the option to join Computer Audio Automatically in zoom settings(and the option to turn off your video by default)
  Check The tickmark when you launch meeting so your browser will not ask everytime to launch zoom
